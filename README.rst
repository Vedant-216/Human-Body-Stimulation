Human Body Modeling and Simulation Project
Project Overview

This repository contains the initial stages of a research project focused on developing comprehensive models of human physiology using machine learning (ML), computational anatomy, and digital twin technology. The project aims to contribute to the field of personalized medicine by integrating various AI methodologies to simulate physiological functions across multiple scales.
Current Focus

    Researching Digital Twins: Exploring the concept of digital twins in healthcare, focusing on how they can be utilized to create real-time simulations of the human body for various medical applications.
    Computational Anatomy: Studying the use of computational models to replicate the anatomy of the human body, including organs and systems, based on medical imaging data.
    Whole-Body Simulation: Investigating whole-body simulations through the Physiome Project and related literature to develop multiscale models that can predict the interactions between different physiological systems.

Objectives

    Multiscale Modeling: The project focuses on developing models that integrate various scales of human physiology, from cellular functions to whole-organism simulations.
    Personalized Medicine: The long-term goal is to contribute to the development of personalized medicine by creating accurate simulations that can predict individual patient responses to treatments.
